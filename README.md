# sentence-generator

Generates sentences using Markov Chains.

I've included a couple sample input files taken from Project Gutenberg, such as Sherlock Holmes and Pride and Prejudice. They're in the input/ directory.

Unfortunately some of the Gutenberg text is a little messed up (some words concatenated for example), so the output can be strange sometimes. I also don't have any measures against reading "sentences" such as "CHAPTER XIV." 

The testing infrastructure is pretty lame since this is just something I tossed together. Run ./tests.sh to run all of the tests. If anything went wrong, an assertion will fail. In the case of a successful run, there will be no output.

# Examples

Some example sentences:

* I had risen out of the copper beechesadventure i could easily do you know.
